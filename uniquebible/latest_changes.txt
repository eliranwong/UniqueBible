Important Notes:
This plugin uses Google Cloud Text to Speech service.
Read more at: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech

To work with this plugin, you need to:
1) Create a credential key and download it.  Read for details at https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/before-you-begin
2) Rename the credential key file to credentials_GoogleCloudTextToSpeech.json
3) Place the credential key file credentials_GoogleCloudTextToSpeech.json in UniqueBibleApp folder.

Remarks: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech is priced based on the number of characters sent to the service to be synthesized into audio each month. 
The first 1 million characters for WaveNet voices are free each month.  1 million characters each month should be free enough for general use.
